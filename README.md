**📊 Bank Marketing ML Web App**

An interactive Streamlit application for data analysis, machine learning, and deployment built using the Bank Marketing Dataset
.
This project automates the end-to-end data science workflow — from data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and user feedback.

🔹 Features

✅ Data Cleaning – Removes null values & duplicates automatically
✅ EDA & Visualization – Descriptive statistics, grouped analysis & interactive charts
✅ Feature Engineering – One-hot encoding, label encoding, and scaling
✅ ML Models – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning – GridSearchCV integration for best parameters
✅ Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, ROC, Confusion Matrix
✅ Deployment – Save trained model as .joblib for reuse
✅ User Feedback – Rate app performance and provide improvement suggestions
✅ Dark/Light Mode – Sidebar toggle for better user experience

**📷 App Workflow**

1.EDA Module

Loads dataset, removes nulls & duplicates

Shows dataset preview, summary statistics

Visualizes insights with bar charts & pie charts

2.Feature Engineering + Machine Learning

Encodes categorical variables

Splits into train/test sets & scales features

Trains ML models with cross-validation

Displays validation results & test performance

3.Deployment

Exports trained ML model as deploy_bank.joblib

Prevents redeployment if already deployed

4.Feedback Section

Allows users to rate (1–3 scale)

Submit improvement suggestions
